* DONE Apostrophe does not match                                        :BUG:

  Apostrophe should work the same as any letter. Meaning that the following
  should match, but it doesn't.
      ----------------------------------------
      zdb "bat'" klingon.zdb
      zdb "bat'leth" klingon.zdb
      ----------------------------------------

  Should work (not result in error message).
      ----------------------------------------
      zdb -- -batlh klingon.zdb
      ----------------------------------------
* DONE Database is clobbered when adding fields                         :BUG:
  CLOSED: [2026-01-08 Thu 17:46]
  The following command, which matches multiple records, clobbers
  'klingon.zdb', overwriting it with a zero-byte file!!

      ----------------------------------------
      zdb 'batlh' hi=nono klingon.zdb
      ----------------------------------------
* TODO Database syntax -- only allow '\t' for indent
  The use of <space> for indentation makes almost all normal text files into
  valid ZDB files which makes far to easy to accidentally/unintentionally
  invoke zdb in a way which messes up some innocent text file.
* Prefix support
  For ':' matches, reduce the inputted entry by removing non-matching fields,
  and replacing them with '[]' (so that the hilite marks are still valid).
* [eof]
